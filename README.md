# Smart Bookmarks

## Introduction

Use [`sb`](http://mrkane27.github.io/sb/) as a search engine in your browser, and you can type things like
`gi boat` to search for pictures of boats, `yt rickroll` to search for videos etc.

You can add your own aliases, for example `alias x http://xkcd.com` or `alias ddgi https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s&iax=images&ia=images`.

Use `list` to see what commands are available.
